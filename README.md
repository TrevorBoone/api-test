This project is creating a basic api to try out django and give a usable API to test other projects I have.
Not particularly useful to anyone but I'll put it on GitHub still since I've been told that posting all my code publicly is 'super cool' so when I work on anything I'll migrate it from my self hosted GitLab to this GitHub.

Some things I've been working on here:
* Testing out using Django for my personal website.
* Creating a multi-user drawing application via python, javascript, and websockets (it's just a dead simple CRDT but I've never used websockets so it's an interesting experiment). I was hoping to get an e-ink monitor to display it on my wall but those are expesive so I was thinking of getting an LED matrix instead. I think it would be really fun wall art and would help making my home feel more connected to people, I know my nieces would love being able to send me drawings over the internet and have them appear for me real-time and my friends would love pranking me with it.
