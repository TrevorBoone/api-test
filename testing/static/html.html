        The main requirement for this website is that it's quick to build.<br><br>
        I've worked with frontend frameworks before but it would take me a few hours to get back to writing productively in any of them while this pure HTML only took me about
        an hour for the whole thing! Even writing it in markdown and doing a simple markdown -> html pipeline would take
        longer.<br><br>
        It's also a good reminder that as an engineer it's easy to way overcomplicate systems for the initial version.
        This is good enough and adding in a nicer style or framework later only 'wastes' a trivial amount of work.
